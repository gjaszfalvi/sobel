# Image Editor (JAVA)

The image editor created in JAVA is a JFrame application.
The user can open an image file (OPEN FILE button) that will be displayed in the left frame (resized if needed).
Two options for image modification is GREYSCALE and SOBEL.
Greyscale obviously displays a desaturated version of the original image in the right frame.
The Sobel is used for edge detection, using SOBEL operator.
